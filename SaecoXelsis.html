In the first stage, we experienced it, observed how people interact with this product, decomposed it and mapped out possible directions to improve the user experience.</p>

                <h2>Key findings for improvements</h2>
                <p>Through the intial empirical studies and research (<a class="saeco-link" href="#research">Read more</a>), we spoted some design flaws and opportunies of contributing to a smooth and satisfying user experience.</p>

                        <h3>Too many steps before brewing coffee</h3>
                        <p>The machine allows users to do 4 to 5 different customisation. However, the user needs to go through at least 6 to 7 steps before they can get their coffee if they want to do all the customizations.</p>

                        <p>There is a profile function that allows the user to make coffee within 3 steps. However, as the profile section is separated from the customization process and the users are easily confused by this function. Thus, they are not willing to use the profile function.</p>

                <h2>Design</h2>
                <p>After the exploration of 3 concepts and tests with peers (<a class="saeco-link" href="#research">Read more</a>), we took away highlights from each of the 3 and have them blended into one new concept that accommodates the majority of our design within a full-color touch screen and a few LEDs embeded in embeded in the maintenance parts.</p>
                <div class="row-img-1" id="product-1"></div>

                <h3>Highlight 01 - Coffee ID</h3>
                <p>The Coffee ID is designed to give quick access to the personal preference (profile) of that drink from the drink page. It is designed to be non-intrusive, so it does not limit the coffee-making experience.

                    The profile panel and customization panel are both placed on the right side of the screen with the same visual style to show the connection between both functions. Each panel can be selected individually. Each panel is displayed in the collapsed view where the selected profile (or default) and an overview of drink settings are presented. They can be expanded to access profiles as a shortcut and coffee customization where coffee settings and profiles are bonded to each other.

                    The design enables multiple ways to access the profiles and it is closely connected to customization because they are inseparable and in the home context profile is a more frequent feature for lazy coffee lovers to interact with than customization.</p>

                <h3>Highlight 02 - Maintenance prediction</h3>
                <p>Maintenance forecast consists of two parts, the maintenance indication bar and the maintenance information page. It is designed to be the main place for monitoring and managing the frequent maintenance of the machine(e.g. Filling water/beans and emptying the coffee grounds tank), aimed at eliminating the hassle caused by maintenance and giving more control over maintenance to users.</p>

                        <p>The maintenance indication bar represents the maintenance status so that users can quickly make a decision, whether to do maintenance or not, by showing the number of coffees that can be made with the ingredients left in the machine. It only shows up when the available ingredients can support three drinks or less. It is intended to work as a mild reminder when maintenance is almost required.</p>

                        <h3>The maintenance information page</h3>
                        <p>By tapping on the maintenance indication bar, the maintenance information page can be accessed. This page will also pop-up when maintenance is being done (e.g. water tank is taken out) and when there are not enough ingredients to make the desired drink.

                            In the maintenance information page, an overview of the amount of water, coffee beans and grounds capacity are displayed and converted to the number of drinks (Americano) that can be made with the available ingredients. By displaying all the information together, users can decide to do other maintenance.</p>

                        <h3>The explanation page of the maintenance information</h3>
                        <p>In the explanation page of the maintenance information, it explains how the machine counts the available cups of coffee. Considered that different kinds of coffee require different amount of ingredients, the ingredients for one cup of Americano (which cost most ingredients) is used as one unit of coffee to guarantee that the user can make whatever what kind of coffee.</p>

                <div class="bruxnomore-info">
                    <p>The redesign sees dramatic improvements in UX, Usability, and perception of a high-end machine. Navigation is much clearer and information is more supportive to understand the system. <br><br>

                        The redesigned feature of Coffee Profile makes the coffee-making process more pleasant to most users, while the new feature maintenance forecast has a very low rate of user adoption mainly because of the failure of visual and verbal communication. The implementation of LED indication improves the finding of parts that require maintenance but its visibility (or position) can be optimized.

                    <h3>3 Concepts</h3>
                    <p>Below the three concepts that are tested during the analysis phase can be
                        found. All concepts focus on the control panel of the coffee machine. They
                        all explore a different way of interaction with the machine. </p>

                            <h3>Concept 1 - Basic screen</h3>
                            <p>This concept focuses on the primary function of coffee making. The machine has a small
                                touch screen with on the left and right of the
                                screen are two buttons for turning the machine
                                on and brewing coffee.<br><br>
                                A mobile application is provided to access the
                                other functions of the machine, like setting up
                                a profile. This machine focuses primarily on
                                making the coffee making process quick.

                            <p>This concept has a complete touch screen
                                where all functionalities are included. The
                                screen gives a quick overview of all the functionalities, choosing a drink, customization
                                and maintenance status of the machine. The
                                machine always gives the user an overview of

                            <p>This concept has a more physical way of interacting with the machine. With a turning knob
                                to control the main functions of the machine.<br><br>
                                There are two displays, one on the turning
                                knob which is showing basic information that
                                changes according to how you turn the knob
                                and what settings you are controlling. The
                                second display on the right to shows more
                                detailed information.

                            <p>Machine Learning, as a technique, has been widely adopted to improve UX. The benefits of employing Machine Learning are appealing, as it learns from users' real data and train models that can make better predictions of, for instance, users' behaviors and preferences.
                            <br><br>
                            It was pointed out that the rules behind the maintenance forecast we created are not trustworthy to some reviewers. However, the issue can be solved by adopting Machine Learning, but it should also be aware of the challenge of user data collection and its cost.

                                Here, with Philips Saeco espresso machine, what if the machine can start preparing a cup of coffee every morning even before you get up from bed, or what if you can simply tell Saeco to make different types of coffee at the same time?</p>
