In the first stage, we experienced it, observed how people interact with this product, decomposed it and mapped out possible directions to improve the user experience.</p>

                <h2>Key findings for improvements</h2>
                <p>Through the intial empirical studies and research (<a class="saeco-link" href="#research">Read more</a>), we spoted some design flaws and opportunies of contributing to a smooth and satisfying user experience.</p>
                
                <h3>While making coffee...</h3>
                <div class="row-img-text">
                    <div class="row-img" id="saeco-finding-1"></div>
                     <div class="row-img-2-text">
                     <h3>Too many steps before brewing coffee</h3>
                     <p>The machine allows users to do 4 to 5 different customisation. However, the user needs to go through at least 6 to 7 steps before they can get their coffee if they want to do all the customizations.</p>
                     </div>

                     <div class="row-img-2-text">
                     <h3>The profile function is not welcomed</h3>
                     <p>There is a profile function that allows the user to make coffee within 3 steps. However, as the profile section is separated from the customization process and the users are easily confused by this function. Thus, they are not willing to use the profile function.</p>

                     <h3>The maintenance requirements pop up in an unexpected moment</h3>
                     <p>For example, adding water is required after the machine has already started grinding the beans. It annoys the users by breaking their expectation of the coffee.</p>

                </div>

                <h2>Design</h2>
                <p>After the exploration of 3 concepts and tests with peers (<a class="saeco-link" href="#research">Read more</a>), we took away highlights from each of the 3 and have them blended into one new concept that accommodates the majority of our design within a full-color touch screen and a few LEDs embeded in embeded in the maintenance parts.</p>

                </div>
                
                <h3>Highlight 01 - Coffee ID</h3>
                <p>The Coffee ID is designed to give quick access to the personal preference (profile) of that drink from the drink page. It is designed to be non-intrusive, so it does not limit the coffee-making experience. 
                    
                The profile panel and customization panel are both placed on the right side of the screen with the same visual style to show the connection between both functions. Each panel can be selected individually. Each panel is displayed in the collapsed view where the selected profile (or default) and an overview of drink settings are presented. They can be expanded to access profiles as a shortcut and coffee customization where coffee settings and profiles are bonded to each other.
                    
                The design enables multiple ways to access the profiles and it is closely connected to customization because they are inseparable and in the home context profile is a more frequent feature for lazy coffee lovers to interact with than customization.</p>

                <h3>Highlight 02 - Maintenance prediction</h3>
                <p>Maintenance forecast consists of two parts, the maintenance indication bar and the maintenance information page. It is designed to be the main place for monitoring and managing the frequent maintenance of the machine(e.g. Filling water/beans and emptying the coffee grounds tank), aimed at eliminating the hassle caused by maintenance and giving more control over maintenance to users.</p>

                     <h3>The maintenance indication bar</h3>
                     <p>The maintenance indication bar represents the maintenance status so that users can quickly make a decision, whether to do maintenance or not, by showing the number of coffees that can be made with the ingredients left in the machine. It only shows up when the available ingredients can support three drinks or less. It is intended to work as a mild reminder when maintenance is almost required.</p>

                     <h3>The maintenance information page</h3>
                     <p>By tapping on the maintenance indication bar, the maintenance information page can be accessed. This page will also pop-up when maintenance is being done (e.g. water tank is taken out) and when there are not enough ingredients to make the desired drink.
                
                In the maintenance information page, an overview of the amount of water, coffee beans and grounds capacity are displayed and converted to the number of drinks (Americano) that can be made with the available ingredients. By displaying all the information together, users can decide to do other maintenance.</p>

                     <h3>The explanation page of the maintenance information</h3>
                     <p>In the explanation page of the maintenance information, it explains how the machine counts the available cups of coffee. Considered that different kinds of coffee require different amount of ingredients, the ingredients for one cup of Americano (which cost most ingredients) is used as one unit of coffee to guarantee that the user can make whatever what kind of coffee.</p>
