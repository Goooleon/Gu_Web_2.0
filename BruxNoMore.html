                            <p>I visited a dentist in a local dental hospital pretending to be a patient with bruxism to understand the medical circumstance and professional attitudes relevent to bruxism. What I have found out was that mouth gaurd is the only one solution available in China from hospital, and patients are always underestimating the damages it could cause.</p>

                            <p>Bruxism sufferers are aware of having Bruxism, but usually underestimate the damages it could cause untill someone keep complaining of the niose to them or they start to feel physical sore and pain. They are pretty much shocked when they were told it may cause further health problems. Based on that, bruxism could be roughly devided into 3 phases in accordance with the symptoms they are having both in physical and mental. Patients in different stages have various needs, but what in common is the access to their bruxism data, info and an efficient way of communicating with other patients.</p>

                            <p>I joined two online bruxism sufferers QQ groups for oberserving what the members care about the most. It has lasted for few months and what I have found was that most of the people don't have much knowledge about it, some of them regarding dentist as incompetent for unabling to have their bruxism cured. Most people were positive to find solutions for hindering bruxism, but the attitude goes to the other end when bruxism gets worse, people would feel desperate about it for no medical solutions could save them from bruxism.</p>
